<h3>A comparison of webpage and similar competing pages:</h3>

A comparison between the Palestine Red Crescent Society and the Al-Harmony
<br /> Charitable Society with the association being established
<br />
<br />
<h3>Design:</h3> The Red Crescent Society and the Harmony Society do not display (social media)
<br />
 sites on the header of the main page, but the page of the association which is stated on them.
<br />
<h4 style="color:blue"><u>The Line:</u></h4> The lines will be in the big project to attract the attention of the spectator to read them,
<br />unlike the current pages where the lines do not stand out or attract the spectator

<h4 style="color:blue"><u>Colors:</u> </h4>Vivid colors will be used to add beauty to the webpage,
<br />
 and do not disturb the spectators &#39;colors and be open unlike the current pages that are covered in most dark and unattractive colors.

<h3 style="color:blue" ><u>Advertising design:</u></h3> It will be a future idea to develop the project and make it contain
<br />different advertisements in order to support many projects that do not depend only on the association project and this is something that is not present in the pages of the existing associations with which comparisons have been made.
